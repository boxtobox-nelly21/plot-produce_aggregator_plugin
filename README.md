Rural Kenya, much like rural Africa, is home to an estimated 70% of the country's population; the overwhelming 
majority of whom are completely reliant on agriculture as their main economic activity. I say _economic activity_
in the lightest manner because the agriculture being practised in most of these places is of a semi-subsistence 
nature. Kenya's agricultural potential has been low with productivity reported to be on a gradual decline leaving
most rural families in a perpetual state of food insecurity and poverty. 

"How can an agriculturally fertile region like this experience perpetual food insecurity and poverty ?" To shed some
light on this mystery, I must quickly paint a portrait of the society in rural Kenya. Before the onset of colonization
and the consequent gradual urbanization, Kenyan society was essentially all 'rural'. This comprised of communities
occupying land subdivided into clans and families. At that point, the subsistence agriculture bring practised was
sufficient to meet the needs of the population, but, as the country's population rose sharply from the 1970s, there
was further subdivision of the land as most people claimed their inheritance from their parents. These events led
to the conditions we see today where the average land size is only about 3 acres per farmer. This is the unlikely
root of this tree that bears food insecurity and poverty. A stroll around the countryside will reveal farmers 
reading from different staffs in the same music sheet and attempting to sing in the same choir. One farmer grows
half an acre of maize, his neighbour grows an acre of beans and two acres of millet, yet another hard-working 
farmer nearby grows cassava, sorghum and a bit of maize in his holdings. Come harvest time and assuming benevolent
weather thus avoiding catastrophic crop failure, each farmer reaps a little bit of this and a little bit of that
but nothing enough to move the needle.

The effort exerted by farmers in rural Kenya, albeit great and diligent, are however disaggregated and are 
unable to put them in a position to take advantage of the economies of scale both during production and in
establishing a relationship with the market.
